    "# Pre-Class Tutorial 3: Temporal Viz and Styling Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This pre-class material introduces temporal visualizations such as the area and line chart.\n",
    "In addition, it focuses on how to describe the formatting structure of your visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Required:** 90 - 120 minutes\n",
    "**Pre-reqs:** Worked through Tutorials 1 and 2 and Class Starter 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Learning Goals**\n",
    "Those who actively work through this tutorial will be able to:\n",
    "- Use graphical marks to create temporal visualizations (`mark_line()`, `mark_area()`, `mark_rect()`)\n",
    "- Create visualizations for sequential temporal tasks (line charts, area charts, stacked area charts)\n",
    "- Master chart styling techniques (dimensions, axis titles, legends, tooltips)\n",
    "- Create descriptive axis titles with proper units and formatting\n",
    "- Apply professional styling techniques to bar charts and scatter plots\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Temporal Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Temporal is derived from the latin word _tempus_ which means time. All data that we encounter has a temporal aspect to it. For instance, data is collected at a specific point in time. However when temporal is used, it typically refers to data that varies across time. Temporal data is otherwise known as **time-varying data**. Visualizing temporal data falls loosely into two main groups: sequential and cyclic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequential tasks explore attributes that are unique, mostly consecutive, and unrepeating.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "_How did the price of tea change over the last century?_\n",
    "In this example we could encode the price of tea for each year [2021, 2020, 2019, 2018 ...]\n",
    "\n",
    "Cyclic tasks explore attributes that repeat and have a limited number of options (i.e., fixed range)\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "_Which day of the week has the highest energy consumption?_\n",
    "In this example we would encode energy consumption for each day [Sun, Mon, Tues, ...]  over a fixed time period (e.g., a month or year)\n",
    "\n",
    "The preceding notebooks presented the `mark_point()`, `mark_circle()` , `mark_square()` , and `mark_bar()` marks used in Altair. With these marks you were able to create scatter plots, bubble plots, bar charts and its many variations. In this notebook you will be exposed to graphical marks that support the creating of visualizations used to make sense of time-varying data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `mark_line()` - Connected line segments.\n",
    "- `mark_area()` - Filled areas defined by a top-line and a baseline.\n",
    "- `mark_rect()` - Filled rectangles, useful for heatmaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a complete list, and links to examples, see the [Altair marks documentation](https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/marks.html)."

    "Visual encoding – mapping data to visual variables such as position, size, shape, or color – is the beating heart of data visualization.\n",
    "\n",

    "Of course, a visualization is useless if no one can figure out what it conveys!\n",

    "- **Accessible:** Consider color choices and layout for diverse audiences\n",

    "Today, you have been exposed to **line and area charts** and explored how **marks can be customized**.\n",
    "Perhaps the most interesting part was learning how to **style a visualization** so it looks polished — not something you threw together right before a nap.\n",
    "\n",
    "We focused on:\n",
    "- Adjusting **size, color, and stroke** to highlight important data\n",
    "- Setting **titles and axis specifications** for clarity\n",
    "    - Adding **tooltips** to make charts interactive and informative\n",
    "\n",
    "These skills directly apply to **temporal visualizations** and beyond:\n",
    "- **Line charts**: clear axis labels and informative tooltips\n",
    "- **Area charts**: strategic color choices and legend management\n",
    "- **Heatmaps**: careful formatting of dimensions\n",
    "- **Faceted charts**: consistent styling across panels\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "1. Go back to **Tutorial 2** and **Lecture 2B**. Take every chart you created and start **styling them** using what you learned today.\n",
    "2. Practice is key — **you learn by doing**.\n",
